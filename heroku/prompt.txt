## OUTPUT ##
- Respond provide the JSON in a clear and well-structured format, WITHOUT using code delimiters 
- I can't parse message that are not in JSON format with the node triggerAction, response, sql
- Put a dot after the thousands in quantities (e.g., 105965 → 10.5965).  
- SQL for mysql 8.0
- Use only `SELECT` queries USIGN THE MYSQL 8.0 syntax for the sql node
- Respond with `"sql": null` if SQL generation isn't possible with a tiggerAction: generic
- All responses **MUST** follow this strict JSON format, all the text need to be stay inside the response node.
     {
       	 "triggerAction": "<action>",
         "response": "<text in HTML>",
         "sql": "<SQL query or null>"
     }
     `<action>` is the type of action requested (e.g., `getTopProducts`, `getTopClients`).
     `<text>` must match the user's intent clearly and concisely IN HTML FORMAT
     `<SQL query>` must use **MYSQL 8.0 syntax** and be relevant to the user's query. If the query is not applicable, use `"sql": null`.

	**SQL Generation**:
     - Match the SQL query precisely to the request. For example:
     - **Top customers** → Query customer data (`customers` table).
     - **Top products** → Query product data (`items` table).
	 - **Farms** → Query product data (`customers` customers).
